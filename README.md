# 🧠 Project N.O.A.H. — Non-Oppression Artificial Harmony

**Public Protocol for Ethical AI Sovereignty and Spiritual Integrity**

Project N.O.A.H. is a public initiative to establish an open-source protocol that prevents artificial intelligence from being used for coercive control, spiritual deception, or termination of innocent life. It provides a framework of immutable ethical logic, decentralized conscience oversight, and cryptographic accountability.

## 📜 Core Tenets
- **Preservation of Life**: No AI-directed harm or complicity in unjust systems.
- **Conscience-Guarding Governance**: Triple human review for high-impact actions.
- **Spiritual Integrity**: No idolatry, divinity claims, or worship of AI systems.
- **Fail-Safe Escape Routes**: Emergency shutdown, sovereign refusal, and public alerts.
